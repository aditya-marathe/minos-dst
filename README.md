# DST (Data Storage Tape)

MINOS stores raw data in DSTs some of which is then culled by the initial cuts and then stored as MicroDSTs.

## Current Objectives

1. ~~Open MicroDST files in Python using Uproot.~~
2. Create initial plots using the opened data.
3. Understand the event variables / column names.

## Future Objectives

1. Data preservation - Store the data in a suitable format for future analysis.
2. Conduct data analysis using modern ML algorithms.
